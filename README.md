# Green Book
Green Book is a movie that came out in 2018 which is true story of a 1962 tour of the Deep South by African American pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank "Tony Lip." This is my favorite movie of all time and I'll tell you three reasons why its my favorite. 

## 1. I love the Great *character Development* in the movie espically from the main character
## 2. Brought me closer with my **BEST FRIEND** 
## 3. I enojoyed it so much that I sat through all of the 2018 *OSCARS* just so my favorite could win
## 4. Khalid, this is a *GREAT* movie suggestion and I cannot wait to see it.
## 5. Khalid, your site looks amazing and the movie sounds so interesting, I would love to watch it.
