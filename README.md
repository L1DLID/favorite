# Green Boook
Green Book is a movie that came out in 2018 which is true story of a 1962 tour of the Deep South by African American pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank "Tony Lip." This is my favorite movie of all time and I'll tell you three reasons why its my favorite. 

## 1. I love the Great *Charater Development* in th movie espically from the main charater 
## 2. Brought me closer with my **BEST FRIEND** 
## 3. I enojoyed it so much that I sat through all of the 2018 *OSCARS* just so my favorite could win
